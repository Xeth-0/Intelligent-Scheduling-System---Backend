# Adaptive Genetic Algorithm Scheduling System

A research-backed three-tier adaptive optimization system that enhances genetic algorithms to escape local minima and handle large chromosome problems effectively.

## üéØ System Overview

This adaptive system addresses key limitations of traditional genetic algorithms:
- **Local minima stagnation**: Gets stuck in suboptimal solutions
- **Large chromosome inefficiency**: Poor performance as problem size grows
- **Static parameter limitations**: Fixed parameters can't adapt to changing search dynamics

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Tier Architecture

### **Tier 1: Penalty Landscape Optimization**
**Purpose**: Reshape the fitness landscape to escape local minima  
**Implementation**: `PenaltyOptimizer.py`  
**Research Basis**: Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning

```python
# When triggered: Every 50 generations or moderate stagnation
# What it does: Uses your existing PenaltyOptimizer to find better penalty weights
# Effect: Changes which solutions are considered "better", breaking local minima
```

### **Tier 2: GA Parameter Adaptation** 
**Purpose**: Dynamically adjust exploration vs exploitation balance  
**Implementation**: `AdaptiveParameterManager.py`  
**Research Basis**: Grefenstette's adaptive scheduling + sklearn-genetic-opt patterns

```python
# Parameters adapted:
# - Mutation rates (gene & chromosome level)
# - Tournament selection pressure  
# - Population size (based on Goldberg scaling laws)
# - Elitism count

# Adaptation triggers:
# - Mild stagnation: Slightly increase exploration
# - Moderate stagnation: Aggressive exploration + adjust selection pressure
# - Severe stagnation: Maximum exploration settings
```

### **Tier 3: Intelligent Population Restart**
**Purpose**: Inject fresh diversity while preserving good solutions  
**Implementation**: `ConvergenceDetector.py` + restart logic  
**Research Basis**: Horn's convergence detection + elite preservation

```python
# When triggered: Severe stagnation (100+ generations without improvement)
# What happens:
# 1. Preserve top 10% elite solutions
# 2. Generate new population with optimized parameters  
# 3. Reset convergence detector
# 4. Continue evolution with fresh diversity
```

## üìä Convergence Detection System

**Implementation**: `ConvergenceDetector.py`

### Jeffrey Horn's Bit-wise Convergence Measure:
```python
# For each gene position (course assignment):
# 1. Count unique assignments across population
# 2. Calculate diversity = unique_assignments / population_size  
# 3. Average across all gene positions
# 4. Population converged when diversity < 10%
```

### Multi-criteria Convergence:
- **Population diversity** (bit-wise measure)
- **Fitness improvement** (relative improvement over N generations)
- **Stagnation duration** (generations without improvement)

## üîß Component Details

### `ConvergenceDetector.py`
- Tracks population diversity using Horn's bit-wise measure
- Monitors fitness improvement over configurable window
- Classifies stagnation severity: none/mild/moderate/severe
- Provides detailed convergence metrics

### `AdaptiveParameterManager.py`  
- Calculates parameter bounds based on problem size
- Implements Goldberg & Deb population sizing formulas
- Adapts parameters based on convergence state
- Tracks adaptation history for analysis

### `AdaptiveGeneticScheduler.py`
- Main orchestrator that integrates all three tiers
- Inherits from your existing `GeneticScheduler`
- Provides `run_adaptive()` method with comprehensive metrics
- Handles escalating interventions based on stagnation severity

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Adaptive Scheduling:
```python
from app.services.AdaptiveGeneticScheduler import AdaptiveGeneticScheduler

# Initialize with adaptive optimization enabled
scheduler = AdaptiveGeneticScheduler(
    courses=courses,
    teachers=teachers, 
    rooms=rooms,
    student_groups=student_groups,
    timeslots=timeslots,
    days=days,
    constraints=constraints,
    enable_adaptive_optimization=True,  # Enable three-tier system
    penalty_optimization_interval=50,   # Tier 1 frequency
    max_restarts=3,                     # Tier 3 limit
)

# Run with comprehensive metrics
solution, fitness, report, metrics = scheduler.run_adaptive(
    generations=1000,
    time_limit=300  # 5 minutes
)

# Analyze adaptive interventions
print(f"Penalty optimizations: {metrics.total_penalty_optimizations}")
print(f"Parameter adaptations: {metrics.total_parameter_adaptations}")  
print(f"Population restarts: {metrics.total_population_restarts}")
```

### Compare Standard vs Adaptive:
```python
from app.services.adaptive_example import compare_standard_vs_adaptive

# Run comparison test
results = compare_standard_vs_adaptive(
    courses, teachers, rooms, student_groups, timeslots, days, constraints
)

print(f"Improvement: {results['improvement_percent']:.2f}%")
```

## üìà Expected Benefits

### **For Large Chromosome Problems**:
- **Adaptive population sizing**: Uses Goldberg scaling laws instead of fixed sizes
- **Dynamic parameter bounds**: Scales mutation rates and selection pressure with problem size
- **Efficient convergence detection**: Window size scales with chromosome length

### **For Local Minima Escape**:
- **Penalty landscape reshaping**: Changes fitness function to reveal new promising areas
- **Progressive intervention**: Light ‚Üí medium ‚Üí heavy interventions as stagnation worsens
- **Elite preservation**: Never loses good solutions during restarts

### **For Solution Quality**:
- **Research-backed parameters**: Uses established formulas, not guesswork
- **Multi-objective awareness**: Considers both fitness and diversity
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Detailed analysis of what worked and when

## üî¨ Mathematical Guarantees

### Population Size Calculation:
```python
# Statistical confidence method (SunTzu/Georgia Tech):
population_size = (1 + B^(-1)) * (chromosome_length + 2)
# where B = 0.05 (confidence interval)

# Goldberg scaling law (simplified):  
population_size = log2(chromosome_length) * 10

# Final: max(both methods), capped at reasonable limits
```

### Hard vs Soft Constraint Separation:
```python
# Your existing PenaltyManager ensures:
min_hard_penalty = max_possible_soft_total + safety_margin
# This mathematically guarantees hard constraints always dominate
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Existing System

The adaptive system is designed to work seamlessly with your current codebase:

1. **Inherits from `GeneticScheduler`**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Uses existing `PenaltyOptimizer`**: No changes needed to Tier 1 system  
3. **Works with current fitness evaluation**: Compatible with your detailed fitness system
4. **Optional activation**: Can be disabled to fall back to standard GA

## üìù Configuration Options

```python
AdaptiveGeneticScheduler(
    # Standard GA parameters (will be adaptively tuned)
    population_size=50,
    gene_mutation_rate=0.1, 
    chromosome_mutation_rate=0.2,
    
    # Adaptive system configuration
    enable_adaptive_optimization=True,        # Enable/disable entire system
    penalty_optimization_interval=50,         # Tier 1 frequency  
    max_restarts=3,                          # Tier 3 maximum restarts
    
    # Convergence detection tuning
    # (automatically calculated based on problem size, 
    #  but can be overridden if needed)
)
```

## üéØ When to Use Adaptive vs Standard GA

### **Use Adaptive GA when**:
- Problem has 50+ courses (large chromosome)
- Standard GA gets stuck repeatedly  
- You need maximum solution quality
- You have time for longer runs (adaptive interventions add overhead)

### **Use Standard GA when**:
- Small problems (< 20 courses)
- Very tight time constraints
- Simple constraint sets
- Quick prototyping

## üìä Performance Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive metrics to understand optimization effectiveness:

```python
class AdaptiveRunMetrics:
    total_generations: int                    # How long did it run?
    total_penalty_optimizations: int         # How many Tier 1 interventions?
    total_parameter_adaptations: int         # How many Tier 2 interventions?  
    total_population_restarts: int           # How many Tier 3 interventions?
    final_fitness: float                     # What quality was achieved?
    final_diversity: float                   # How diverse was final population?
    convergence_history: List[ConvergenceMetrics]  # Detailed evolution tracking
    adaptation_summary: Dict[str, Any]       # Parameter adaptation analysis
    execution_time: float                    # Total runtime
    best_generation: int                     # When was best solution found?
```

This comprehensive system transforms your genetic algorithm from a static optimization technique into an intelligent, self-adapting solver that can handle the complexity of real-world university scheduling problems.
